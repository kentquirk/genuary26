        A rectangular spiral pattern where each segment is divided into a number of smaller
        rectangles based on the Fibonacci sequence.

        This sketch draws a rectangular spiral pattern where each segment's length is determined
        by the Fibonacci sequence. The thickness of the lines and the colors can be randomized
        to create different visual effects. I had trouble deciding what to do with this prompt,
        so it's not very sophisticated.
