        I made the word with ASCII art in the source code, then used that image to fill in a grid with
        "solid" cells where the letters are. Then I made a bunch of balls that bounce around the screen,
        bouncing off the walls and each other, and erasing the grid cells they roll over while bouncing
        off the solid cells. The balls have random sizes and speeds and collide with each other, so they
        eventually clear the whole word away.
