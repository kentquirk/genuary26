        This sketch implements a cellular automaton on a grid where each cell
        can implement boolean logic operations (AND, OR, NOT) based on the
        states of its neighboring cells. The neighborhood is defined as the four
        adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). The cells can be colored by the
        user to set their logic function, and the automaton evolves over time
        based on these functions. If you enjoy Conway's Game of Life, you'll
        likely find this sketch intriguing as it introduces logical operations
        into the cellular automaton framework.
