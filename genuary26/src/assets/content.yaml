      subtitle: (The textile design patterns of public transport seating)
      timestamp: Genuary 9, 2025
      image: subwaytextile.png
      alt: A pattern of colored lines forming a grid that is similar to the patterns on the seats in a subway.
      body: Vertical and horizontal stripes in 4 colors, with the spacing between them varying sinusoidally.

      title: Isometric
      subtitle: (No vanishing points)
      timestamp: Genuary 5, 2025
      image: iso.png
      alt: A 3D isometric view of a grid of colored blocks.
      body: |
        This is an isometric view of a grid of colored blocks. The blocks are
        randomly colored and the grid is randomly generated. The camera is fixed
        and the blocks are animated to slide around the grid without colliding.

    - name: fortytwo
      title: Forty-Two
      subtitle: (exactly 42 lines of code)
      timestamp: Genuary 3, 2025
      image: fortytwo.png
      alt: The number 42 animated against a colored background.
      body: |
        This is a simple animation of the number 42. The point was only 42 lines
        of code, which I interpreted to mean the JS file containing the script.

    - name: layersonlayers
      title: Layers on Layers on Layers
      subtitle: (and also Black on Black)
      timestamp: Genuary 2 AND 4, 2025
      image: layersonlayers.png
      alt: |
        Brightly colored circles, triangles, and squares on a red background,
        showing fading trails of their past motion.
      body: |
        Simple shapes, simple motion, but we don't clear the screen each frame,
        so we see layers of the movement history. The black on black version is a
        little more subtle.

      subtitle: (Only vertical and horizontal lines.)
      timestamp: Genuary 1, 2025
      image: vortech.png
      alt: An image viewed through a Voronoi mesh and colored with only vertical and horizontal lines.
      body: |
        This is a Voronoi diagram overlaying an image, where each cell is colored
        with only vertical and horizontal lines. Doesn't really work (yet) on
        mobile, sorry.

      image: parametrix.png
      alt: A sinusoidal pattern with smoothly varying colors and line width
      body: |
        A graphical system where every parameter can be controlled by a function
        of t. Can be static or animated.
