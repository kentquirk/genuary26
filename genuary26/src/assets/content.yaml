        A rectangular spiral pattern where each segment is divided into a number of smaller
        rectangles based on the Fibonacci sequence.

        This sketch draws a rectangular spiral pattern where each segment's length is determined
        by the Fibonacci sequence. The thickness of the lines and the colors can be randomized
        to create different visual effects. I had trouble deciding what to do with this prompt,
        so it's not very sophisticated.

        We start by drawing a big triangle that nearly fills the canvas. Then we
        generate larger and larger groups of smaller and smaller triangles, alternating
        between black and the chosen color. All the triangles are randomly rotated.
