      title: Fib-ics
      subtitle: Fibonacci forever. Create a work that uses the Fibonacci sequence in some way.

        A rectangular spiral pattern where each segment is divided into a number of smaller
        rectangles based on the Fibonacci sequence.
      body: |
        This sketch draws a rectangular spiral pattern where each segment's length is determined
        by the Fibonacci sequence. The thickness of the lines and the colors can be randomized
        to create different visual effects. I had trouble deciding what to do with this prompt,
        so it's not very sophisticated.

      title: Write 'Genuary'. Don't use a font.
      subtitle: Let's use bouncing balls to play breakout with letters.
      day: 5
      timestamp: Genuary 5, 2026
      image: genuary.png
      alt: A still shot of bouncing balls flying around a grid with letters almost forming the word "Genuary".
      body: |
        I made the word with ASCII art in the source code, then used that image to fill in a grid with
        "solid" cells where the letters are. Then I made a bunch of balls that bounce around the screen,
        bouncing off the walls and each other, and erasing the grid cells they roll over while bouncing
        off the solid cells. The balls have random sizes and speeds and collide with each other, so they
        eventually clear the whole word away.

    - name: logicgrid
      title: Logic Grid
      subtitle: Boolean Logic / Cellular Automaton
      day: 7
      timestamp: Genuary 7 & 9, 2026
      image: logicgrid.png
      alt: A regular grid of squares, some filled in black and some white, forming a pattern.
      body: |
        This sketch implements a cellular automaton on a grid where each cell
        can implement boolean logic operations (AND, OR, NOT) based on the
        states of its neighboring cells. The neighborhood is defined as the four
        adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). The cells can be colored by the
        user to set their logic function, and the automaton evolves over time
        based on these functions. If you enjoy Conway's Game of Life, you'll
        likely find this sketch intriguing as it introduces logical operations
        into the cellular automaton framework.

      title: Low Res Imagery
      subtitle: (Lowres. An image or graphic with low resolution, where details are simplified or pixelated.)
      day: 4

      image: lores.png
      alt: |
        A reduced-resolution image (randomly chosen) that is actually split into its RGB color channels,
        by pressing the "Jump!" button, channels will bounce.
      body: |
        Just playing with low-resolution images, color channels, and blending modes.

    - name: oneshape
      title: One Shape, One Color
      subtitle: (Triangles)
      day: 1
      timestamp: Genuary 1, 2026
      image: oneshape.jpg
      alt: Triangles in various sizes and orientations, all the same color.
      body: |
        We start by drawing a big triangle that nearly fills the canvas. Then we
        generate larger and larger groups of smaller and smaller triangles, alternating
        between black and the chosen color. All the triangles are randomly rotated.
